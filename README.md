# Summary

I remember playing this old classic Snake Game on a Nokia 3310 back when i was a child (good times!). Furthermore, now that i got to test my skills and knowledge about programming with this application. Felt like i hit a wall. Those challenges that i faced were worth the while. Thus, sharpens my newly programing skills and understanding how HTML Canvas and JavaScript work together to give a "2d" animitation "motion".
